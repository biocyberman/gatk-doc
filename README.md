========

If you find it hard to following very fragmented documentations about GATK and Queue, this repo is for you. 

It is an attempt to create one-stop documentation for Broad Institute's GATK and Queue tools. This aims to produce one final file in HTML or PDF to view offline, online or even printing if needed.

The content is taken from GATK's homepage (https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk) and converted to Tex format. PDF and HTML files are then produced with correct version number for earch release. 

For normal users, who are only intrested in getting the nice and clean formatted documentations, just download the desirable zip files which contains both HTML and PDF final outputs. 

I hope in the long run, GATK team will also join this repo and update there documentations directly here.
